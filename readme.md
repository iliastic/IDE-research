## download link:

Pro's | Contra's
------------ | -------------
free | slow if you start it up
Nice design, active package (extension) community. | It cannot handle files bigger than a couple MB's
Easy to customize the UI | once in awhile the editor freezes during usage

### *I chose this **IDE** especially because*:
1. It's a complete IDE for free. 
2. Search for and install new packages it's easy to do and good to make it more personal
